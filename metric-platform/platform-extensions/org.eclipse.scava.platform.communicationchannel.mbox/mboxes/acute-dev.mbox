Hi all, hi Lucas,

I've set up some jobs on EpVc6u8SjcWij5iV@gFK8iBb86ii4/IuW for aCute:
http://ci.eclipse.org/acute/
The main one (acute-snapshots) builds the HEAD commit from master branch
and deploys it to download.eclipse.org.
I tried to enable tests, but some of the SWTBot tests are failing. Please
see the bottom of https://ci.eclipse.org/acute/job/aCute-snapshots/8/console
for the related message.
What can be the most probable cause for those failures? A wrong dotnet core
version? Or maybe another environment issues (SWTBot tends to be very picky
with X/WindowManager) ?

Thanks in advance for your insights,
--

Hi,

This does not look like a dotnet issue. Here are my thoughts on each of the
failing tests:

testNewLocation
(org.eclipse.acute.SWTBotTests.dotnetnew.TestProjectCreation)
    I believe it took too long to build the project as its the first time
running the build command and downloads are required. Can try increasing
the wait time.

testAddToWorkingSet
(org.eclipse.acute.SWTBotTests.dotnetnew.TestProjectCreation)
    The "Working set name:" text field is visible but somehow the Finish
button is not. Could it be that a non new / too new version of eclipse is
being used and the the 'Finish' button has differet text?

testDotnetRun(org.eclipse.acute.SWTBotTests.dotnetrun.TestRun)
    Unable to find terminated dotnet exec task, however the program ran
successfully by the looks of the 'Hello World' output. Either the debug
view was not visible or the program exited with a non-zero code. I am able
to add to the testcase error output to give us more information.

If I create a patch with some potential fixes and create a PR, will the
Jenkins tests be ran against it or is it only on the master branch?

Also to confirm, with builds #9 and up, the tests have been disabled
correct?

It's only against the master branch, and we won't use Jenkins for PRs at
the moment. However, if you want, I can create a job on Jenkins for one of
your branches that would build the same as master, but using your code so
you can see how it works.

Correct. I did add the "-DskipTests=true" flag to Maven step.

If you would be able to set up the test or point me in the right direction
to do so we will be able to get more info on what is going on.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

Dear PMC,

We would like to have Eclipse aCute (for C# development in Eclipse IDE)
included in the SImultaneous Release and did announce it the
cross-project-issues-dev.
The issue is that the current quality of aCute is not sufficient for us to
consider as ready for SimRel, and this depends mostly on some change in an
upstream non-Eclipse.org project we're using (OmniSharp). As soon as
OmniSharp releases a newer version including the change we're waiting for,
aCute should be safe to go into SimRel.
The big issue is that we don't know, nor have the power/influence to
estimate or change, when OmniSharp will release our needed feature. So we
cannot actually commit on a date when aCute can be perceived as good enough
for SimRel.
Wayne informed that as of now, the SimRel process doesn't have a path for
such projects who would like to be part of SimRel but cannot guarantee
they'll be able to actually be in; and suggested that I ask the PMC to
cascade the request to Planning Council.
One important thing to note in this discussion is that we do not expect any
other Eclipse.org project to depend on aCute. aCute has no public API, is
still incubating, and we wouldn't advise anyone to start building on top of
it. So, hopefully, the presence or not of aCute in SimRel shouldn't affect
any other project.

My impression in that for this case, we could ask the Planning Council to
set up a new rule to allow such "we'd like to get it but we're not sure
we'll be able" projects to come in or out late in the release train, if
it's clear that no other project should build on top of it and if project
(aCute in that case) agrees to some constraints that Planning Council would
consider necessary.

Can you please bring this to the next Planning Council and advise?

Thanks in advance!

I don't consider that stating in November that aCute would like to be in by
June is a rush ;)
But you're right, if going into Photon.1 is the only path possible, it's
not so bad.

 And if you really want to get it into Photon.0, it might be easier to ask

I agree. But in that case, it means that the "state intent early" rule is
not so necessary. I think it's something Planning Council should clarify.
For example by saying "state intent early, but it's fine if you don't and
the project isn't upstream of anything".

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

Hi all,

I'm pleased to report that after a week of work, I could integrate a
debugger in Eclipse aCute over the Debug Adapter Protocol, supported by
LSP4E.
Here is the video demo:
http://www.screencast.com/users/mistria/folders/Default/media/23b83e66-6219-4ca8-89fd-1a1cf245aa48

The debugger is https://github.com/Samsung/netcoredbg/ . It seems pretty
functional and is OSS under MIT (as opposed to Microsoft's vsdbg which is
closed source with strong technical and legal restrictions preventing usage
in non-Microsoft products). The maintainer was very reactive to the issues
I reported and kindly implemented DAP support and easy packages quite
promptly just one request. So while it's not a project shining in the
typical ways pseudo-analysts use to evaluate a project health (ie not a lot
of commits, not a lot of stars, not a lot of forks), it appeared to me as a
very serious project, that is working properly and that is able to react
very promptly to non-trivial feature requests.
This debugger has support for the Debug Adapter Protocol. So the first step
was to integrate it over the standard DAP Launch Configuration offered by
LSP4E to see whether the binding work. And it did work.
Then I created some specific launch configurations (that's what Jonah
-autor of DAP support in LSP4E- recommends) to only show user(dotnet
developers)-oriented preferences and generate the DAP description from
them. This also worked well; but it definitely requires several days of
work and some expertise in Eclipse plug-in development. It's relatively
cheap for the extremely high value, so the ROI is very high; but it's a
still a bit frustrating that it requires Eclipse developers to do it (while
the LSP integration is relatively accessible to plain Java developers).
Finally, since the debugger is MIT license, it could be included as
fragments inside the delivery so it's available by default (on Linux 64bits
and Mac only so far, as netcoredbg doesn't ship yet Windows package).

I think this completely validates the DAP stack and it brings aCute a
serious step forward, opening up a can of new ideas and questions like
"should we try to take a bit of marketshare of .NET developers?".

Cheers,

Hi all,

I'd like to remove Eclipse aCute from Simultaneous Release.

While being included in SimRel requires some efforts and puts extra
pressure, we do not see any clear ROI for aCute at the moment compared to
what's possible without SimRel, both for end-users (basically Marketplace
is enough for aCute as we are not likely to produce an EPP package at the
moment) or for maintainers (aCute already manages to intergate well with
upstream projects without being in SimRel).
This may change in the future, if C# becomes more successful or if C#
developers like to move to other non-Micosoft IDEs, but it's not really the
trend we see and current contributors cannot (and even want to?) change
that just with aCute.

If anyone wants to step in and take care of inclusion in SimRel, of
creation of EPP packages for C#/.NET Core, or whatever in favor of making
the project more widely used, they would for sure be welcome; so feel free
to speak up!

Cheers

By the way, I'd like to use this as an opportunity to remind that
(according to our experience with Corrosion/Rust EPP) some EPP packages
really fail at reaching their full audience because of
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=506244 . I can't wait to read
some news from the Board or EMO about it...
Basically, https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=506244 is also
involved in the removal of aCute from SimRel: if including a JRE in EPP
were approved (like it seems to be for Docker-based deliveries), then we
may have seen more interest in aCute shipped as EPP and aCute would have
been forced to remain in SimRel.
