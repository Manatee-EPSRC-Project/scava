\chapter{General features}

In this chapter we present several functions which can not be linked to any single feature.
These embodied an overview about the general principles which interwove the whole plug-in.

\section{Installation guide}
Update sites are used to organize and export features so they can be installed into Eclipse applications. A feature is used to package a group of plug-ins together into a single installable and updatable unit. Features have a manifest that provides basic information about the feature and its content. content may include plug-ins, fragments and any other files that are important for the feature. A feature can also include other features. The delivery format for a feature is a JAR, but each included plug-in will be provided as a separate JAR.

\subsection{Create an update site with Eclipse IDE}

First of all, you need to create a feature, from our plug-in. You can create a new feature by creating a New Feature Project. After your feature project is completed, you have to add our plug-in in feature.xml Included Plug-ins tab as Figure~\ref{fig:feature} shows.

\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pic/feature.png}
	\caption{Included plug-ins window}
	\label{fig:feature}
\end{figure}

When your feature is ready, you have to create an update site. You can create a new update site by creating a New Update Site Project. After your update site project is completed, you have to add the feature in site.xml Site Map tab as Figure~\ref{fig:update} shows. After you added the feature to site.xml you can Build an update site.


\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pic/update_site.png}
	\caption{Site Map window}
	\label{fig:update}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Install plug-in via an update site}

To install plug-in via an update site select the \textit{Install new software} under the Help menu in Eclipse. As you see on Figure~\ref{fig:install_updatesite} the following window you can choose the location of the update site. The location can be a remote or local one. After you select the update site's location it will be shown in the list. You can browse the plug-in's features and disable it if it is not necessary for you. After you are ready, click the \textit{Next} button. On the following screen you have to accept the license agreement if you want to continue the installation. The last screen you see the installation details, on this screen there is a list which contains all of the selected feature for your installation. To finish the installation process click on the \textit{Finish} button.

\chapter{Acquire Recommendations}

There are several kind of suggestions and recommendation which could be helpful for the developer during their daily tasks. In this chapter we introduce those features which result some kind of recommendation. One of the main properties is the type of entity which are the subject of the suggestion. To simplify any further discussion our tool only permit recommendation with a single subject type. You can find more details in the following sections.

\req[\waitingForServer\todo{Nothing to do directly on IDE side?}]{U1}{Able to extract the development dependencies of a project}{\SHALL}
\req[\waitingForServer\todo{Nothing to do directly on IDE side?}]{U2}{Able to extract the test dependencies of a project}{\SHALL}
\req[\waitingForServer\todo{Nothing to do directly on IDE side?}]{U3}{Able to extract the runtime dependencies of a project}{\SHALL}

\req[\todom]{U157}{Eclipse IDE proposes filtering options for recommendations}{\SHALL}

\req[\waitingForServer\todo{It is a MAY. Howto: e.g. label recommendation as TEST}]{U223}{Provides recommendations to improve test coverage}{\MAY}

\req[\inprogress]{D75}{Recommendation query shall be initiated from the menu, from context menus, and from the toolbar in the IDE. So the user can easily start working with the recommendations.}{\SHALL}
\req[\todom{} \waitingForServer\todo{Some recommendation types needs to be defined in details (with examples).}]{D76}{The IDE shall use a view to list the code recommendations for the examined project. The view shall provide hierarchical grouping of listed items, filtering by meta-properties, and navigation.}{\SHALL}
\req[\waitingForServer\todo{API needs to be defined. According to L'Aquila the server will receive only a string from a prepared set of options.}]{U167}{CROSSMINER IDE provides the ability for the developer to give feedback on the usefulness of the advices in the given situation}{\SHALL}
\req[\waitingForServer\todo{Not IDE! Needed for U167 and D79}]{D105}{The CROSSMINER REST API should provide an interface that allows the user to report if the answer of query previously returned by the API was inappropriate answer for the query. So the knowledge base gets feedback and can be improved.}{\SHOULD}

\section{Library Based Recommendations}

Recommendation which subject are libraries are called \emph{library based recommendations.} This feature helps you to search libraries whiches fit in your development process.

\req[N/A\todo{WEB Dashboard functionality}]{U4}{Able to warn about superfluous dependencies}{\SHOULD}
\req[N/A\todo{WEB Dashboard functionality}]{U5}{Able to warn about overly precise dependencies}{\SHOULD}

\req[\done]{U81}{Able to identify and list the third-party components used in a project.}{\SHALL}
\todoi{U81: If we can support all case studies, then the current, client-side maven-based identification is enough.}

\req[\inprogress]{D78}{The IDE shall provide an interface to the user, where libraries that match some recommendations are listed with their selected set of details in filterable and sortable form. So the developer can easily compare the libraries and choose those best fit to their expectations.}{\SHALL}
\req[\waitingForServer]{D79}{The IDE should provide the ability to the user to mark a library proposed for a query as ``not appropriate''. This information can help in the improvement of the knowledge base.}{\SHOULD}
\req[\done]{D80}{The IDE shall provide an interface where known information from a single library is shown. This interface can help the user to check details of the library, and reach out for more information through links (e.g. to project home page).}{\SHALL}
\req[\waitingForServer\todo{Not IDE! Needed for D78}]{D100}{The CROSSMINER REST API shall provide an interface that accepts a name and version description and returns the library that is described by them.}{\SHALL}
\req[\done\todo{Not IDE! Needed for D78}]{D101}{The CROSSMINER REST API shall provide an interface that accepts a library and returns detailed information about it (including description, metric values, URLs).}{\SHALL}

\subsection{Searching Additional Libraries}

One sub-type of library based recommendation when the goal of the developer is to find new libraries based on some user specified search criteria.


To use this feature select the Library Search item under the CROSSMINER tab in the toolbar. To search differenct libraries, which are needed for your project enter its name (or part of it) and click on the \textit{Search} button. After a succesful search a list of libraries will be shown under a new tab. A list of libraries which meet the requirement will be shown on the left side of the window. You can easily switch between them. You can run different searches which are open a new tab. To switch between them click on the tab header. You can close this result with the cross on the tab header if you no longer want to use it. 
You can see on Figure~\ref{fig:librarySearchWindow} the user search for json library. The results are on the left side of the window and central panel holds information about the selected library.

To get information about the libraries select the list item. After selection the central panel shows information about the libraries and provides weblinks to the library GitHub repository and the Crossminer WebDashboard. The link opens webpage in your default browser, if you did not set up default browser an error message will be shows up.  If you find the right library you can simply add it to the installer queue just by clicking on the \textit{Add} button under the library name. The libraries which are selected for the installation will appear on the right side of the window. To start the installation click on the \textit{OK} button.

\end{figure}


\req[\waitingForServer\todo{Source code recommendation on the IDE side, ready.}]{U172}{CROSSMINER IDE provides developers code templates and example of codes related to the usage of the API of a specific project}{\SHALL}
\req[\todom{} \waitingForServer\todo{On the IDE side, it is a free text search (with some pre-defined constraints, if needed.)}]{D77}{The IDE shall provide an interface, where recommendations against a new (to-be-used-in-the-project) library can be given. So the user can describe features and functionalities they wants to perform using an external library. The user can also give some constraints, e.g. minimal age or users of the library.}{\SHALL}

\req[\waitingForServer]{U172}{CROSSMINER IDE provides developers code templates and example of codes related to the usage of the API of a specific project}{\SHALL}
\todoi{U172: A new sub-type of code recommendations is needed to handle code templates.

The details of the communication must be defined.}

\req[\todom{} \waitingForServer\todo{On the IDE side, it is a free text search (with some pre-defined constraints, if needed). Free text search is okay as far as it satisfies all the use cases.}]{D77}{The IDE shall provide an interface, where recommendations against a new (to-be-used-in-the-project) library can be given. So the user can describe features and functionalities they wants to perform using an external library. The user can also give some constraints, e.g. minimal age or users of the library.}{\SHALL}

\req[\inprogress{} \waitingForServer\todo{Not IDE! Needed for D77.}]{D99}{The CROSSMINER REST API shall provide an interface that accepts a description and some filtering constraints and returns a list of libraries that match with the description and fulfil the constraints.}{\SHALL}

\subsection{Searching Similar Libraries}

There are usually some pre-existing selection of libraries which serve as a base to find more relevant API-s. We split these kind of recommendations into two major sub-categories: whether the pre-existing set of libraries are already installed or not.

\req[\waitingForServer\todo{Not IDE! Needed for U174}]{D102}{The CROSSMINER REST API shall provide an interface that accepts a library, a description and some filtering constraints and returns a list of libraries that match with the description, fulfill the constraints, and can be used as a replacement to the given library.}{\SHALL}

\subsubsection{Suggestion Based on Non-installed Libraries}

If you want to search libraries not by its name but its funcionality use search similar libraries function. This function placed on the bottom of each library details. Select a library and scroll the description all the way down. On Figure~\ref{fig:librarySimilar} user select simple-json library by fangyidong which is a well-know json parser library. The user also searched library which are similars to this. To search similar libraries like the selected one click \textit{Search similars with method} link on the bottom of the information page. This method will open a new tab where you can browse among similar libraries.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pic/librarySearchSimilars.png}
	\caption{Similar libraries like the selected one}
	\label{fig:librarySimilar}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Suggestion Based on Already Installed Libraries}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pic/librarySearchFinish.png}
	\caption{Library search finish}
	\label{fig:libraryInstall}
\end{figure}

Before the plug-in requests recommendation about how to installs the selected libraries you can search for additional libraries based on third party APIs already present in you Maven settings. The interface offers a special list of libraries which is based on the previously installed ones. If your project isn't a Maven project, this feature is not work for you, the plugin process the Maven Pom file to detect installed libraries. You can select which libraries will be used during the search. To select relevant libraries use the checkboxes. On Figure~\ref{fig:librarySimilar} user have three installed libraries and select that all of them is relevant to similiarity search. To search additional libraries click on the \textit{Search for additional libraries} button. This action opens a new tab which is similar to the previous search results view, but this library list contains those libraries which are similiar to the currently installed ones. You can add libraries to the list the same way as you did it before. To finalize installation process select the \textit{OK} button and the plug-in will install the selected libraries.

\req[\waitingForServer\todo{Not IDE! Needed for D81}]{U174}{CROSSMINER IDE provides suggested alternatives to the usage of third-party jar which offer the same range of services as a jar used in current project}{\SHOULD}
\req[\todom{} \waitingForServer]{D81}{The IDE shall provide an interface to the user, where recommendations for replacing a library used in the current project with some alternative libraries can be given. The user can select the library currently used in the project to be replaced and can give further recommendations against the alternatives.}{\SHALL}

\subsection{Handling Changed and Deprecated APIs}

Third party libraries are prone to change and evolution.
To help the developers adapt their project to these changes we defined an other sub-category of recommendations, namely when their goal is to provide information about modified or deprecated interfaces.

\req[\waitingForServer\todo{Not IDE! Needed for U160-162, U164, U168, U169}]{U70}{Able to identify the list of changed third-party API methods from the source code of the third-party API}{\SHALL}
\req[\waitingForServer\todo{Not IDE! Needed for U160-162, U164, U168, U169}]{U71}{Able to identify the list of deprecated third-party API methods from the source code of the third-party API}{\SHALL}
\req[\waitingForServer\todo{Not IDE! Needed for U160-162, U164, U168, U169, U173, U175}]{U72}{Able to determine migration pattern from two (or more) code snippets when one of them uses the old third-party API and the other uses the new third-party API}{\SHALL}

\req[\waitingForServer\todo{Not IDE! Nedded for U160-162, U164, U168, D83-84}]{U80}{Able to detect from the configuration settings if a new version of a used third-party library is available}{\SHALL}
\req[\waitingForServer\todo{Not IDE! Nedded for U160-162, U164, U168, D82-84}]{U130}{Able to identify if the developer is not using the most recent version of a library and provide notification}{\SHALL}

\req[\todom{} \waitingForServer]{U160}{CROSSMINER IDE notifies if a new version of a third-party API used by the project on which the developer is working is available}{\SHALL}
\req[\todom{} \waitingForServer]{U161}{CROSSMINER IDE notifies if a new version of a third-party API used by the project on which the developer is working breaks backward compatibility}{\SHALL}
\req[\todom{} \waitingForServer]{U162}{CROSSMINER IDE is able to offer the use of the newest version of a third-party API utilised in the project}{\MAY}
\req[\inprogress{} \waitingForServer]{U163}{CROSSMINER IDE is able to identify and navigate to those places that became suspicious for changing behaviour after the third-party API version used in the project has changed}{\SHALL}

\req[\todom{} \waitingForServer]{D82}{The IDE shall provide the user the ability to initiate library version check. So the user is notified if some libraries used in their project have new versions.}{\SHALL}
\req[\todom{} \waitingForServer]{D83}{The IDE shall perform library version checks on the libraries used in the current project. The check is performed on project load, and only marks the upgradeable libraries.}{\SHALL}
\req[\todom{} \waitingForServer]{D84}{The IDE shall be able to show if a library used in the current project has a new version that satisfies some pre-determined criteria set globally for library upgrades by the user. So the user can see the relevant results of the library upgrade search.}{\SHALL}

\req[\inprogress{}\todo{ready, up to date}]{D86}{The IDE should provide the ability to initiate a library upgrade that marks all those places in the source code that needs rework due to the change of the library version.}{\SHOULD}
\req[\inprogress{}\todo{ready, up to date}]{D88}{The IDE may perform the steps of a library upgrade autonomously (if the user requested the upgrade).}{\MAY}
\req[\inprogress{} \waitingForServer\todo{Not IDE!}]{D103}{The CROSSMINER REST API shall provide an interface that accepts a library and filters, and returns a list of versions available for that library and match the filters.}{\SHALL}
\req[\waitingForServer\todo{Not IDE! Needed for D86, D88}]{D104}{The CROSSMINER REST API shall provide an interface that accepts a library and two versions, and returns the differences between these library versions. Differences include removed, deprecated, changed, new API elements, and API elements with changed behaviour.}{\SHALL}

\section{Source Code Based Recommendations}

In this section we elaborate features related to those recommendation which subject entities are present in the source code of the project under development. They usually retrieve some code chunk, which could be annotated to ease further understanding.

\req[\inprogress\todo{Not IDE! Needed for U170-171...}]{U73}{Able to identify the part of the API that the developer is currently using to provide code snippets in relation with current development activity}{\SHALL}
\req[\inprogress{} \waitingForServer\todo{no data for ``as suspicious''}]{U170}{CROSSMINER IDE provides the ability for the developer to ask recommendations for a code chunk previously marked by the CROSSMINER IDE as suspicious}{\SHOULD}
\req[\done]{U171}{CROSSMINER IDE provides the ability for the developer to ask recommendation for an arbitrary code chunk or code element}{\SHOULD}

\req[\inprogress]{D92}{The IDE should provide the ability to the user to select a code snippet or a file and ask for code recommendations for it. So the user can check whether there is a better practice to solve her problem.}{\SHOULD}
\todoi{D92: Code recommendations for arbitrary code is enough.
The CROSSMINER API should provide a point where context information (the whole project?) can also be uploaded (Davide said that it already exists).
The content and form of it must be discussed.}

\req[\inprogress]{D93}{The IDE should be able to show recommendations assigned with code elements. So the user can see what the knowledge base suggested for a code snippet.}{\SHOULD}
\todoi{D93: Code recommendations for arbitrary code can be enough, but the CROSSMINER API can also provide a point for code element recommendations.
The CROSSMINER API should provide a point where context information (the whole project?) can also be uploaded (Davide said that it already exists).
The content and form of it must be discussed.}

\req[\waitingForServer\todo{Not IDE! Needed for U170-171, D91-94}]{D107}{The CROSSMINER REST API may provide an interface that accepts code snippets and library context, and returns recommendations on how to improve that part of the code.}{\MAY}

\subsection{Retrieving Suggested Code Snippets}

Based on the current development context, our plug-in is able to yield a set of source code snippets (code chunks), which could be useful to implement or to understand various features.
This feature helps to improve your code quality based on your suggested code snippet. The plug-in able to give you a recommendation how to change your code to improve it. To use this feature select a code chunk and press the right mouse button. In the context menu select the \textit{Request Recommendation} under the CROSSMINER entry.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pic/coderecommender.png}
	\caption{Code recommendation view}
	\label{fig:coderecommender}
\end{figure}

As shown on Figure~\ref{fig:coderecommender} the plugin (in this example) suggest two code improvements for your selected code chunk. You can browse them and inspect the source code. To insert the selected source code click on the \textit{Insert at cursor} button. This action will insert the code at your current cursor location and if there is a selected code chunk then it will be replaced. The recommended source code is a pattern, it only helps you to understand the logic but it is not guaranteed to be semantically (or in rare occasions, syntactical) correct.

\req[\done\todo{done, up to date}]{D91}{The IDE may insert a recommendation in the code if the user accepts it and requested it on a code position.}{\MAY}
\req[\inprogress{} \waitingForServer\todo{``IDE replaces ...'' will probably not be implemented, unless the server gives proper recommendations}]{D94}{The IDE may be able to process recommendations and perform code migration autonomously. So the user can point to a recommendation and the IDE replaces the old code to the new one.}{\MAY}
\req[\waitingForServer\todo{Not IDE! Needed for U170-171, D91-94}]{D106}{The CROSSMINER REST API may provide an interface that accepts a list of libraries and a description and returns recommendations about how to implement the described functionality using the given libraries.}{\MAY}

\section{Text Based Recommendations}

Finally there are tons of documentation and discussion available for various topics, which could be useful for the developers. Those recommendations which yield some natural language documents (or reference to them) are called \emph{text based recommendations.}

\subsection{API Usage}

Developers could use these recommendation to get more information about the features and their usage of a 3rd part API, for example official pages, documentations, and samples.

\req[\todom{} \todo{It is a MAY. Davide said that the API is prepared for sending context-data}\waitingForServer]{D89}{The IDE may provide an interface where description of a feature to be implemented and libraries that should be used to implement it can be given. So the user can ask for recommendations how to implement features using specific libraries.}{\MAY}
\req[\todom{} \todo{It is a MAY. Davide said that the API is prepared for sending context-data}\waitingForServer]{D90}{The IDE may provide an interface to show recommendations on how to implement a feature using some specific libraries.}{\MAY}

\subsection{Handling API changes}

There several forum threads and change reports, which could ease the migration between different versions of the same library.

\req[\todom{} \waitingForServer]{U165}{CROSSMINER IDE offers a list of community discussion forums concerning the use of a changed third-party API element}{\SHOULD}
\req[\todom{} \waitingForServer]{U166}{CROSSMINER IDE offers code examples for deprecated third-party API usage points}{\SHOULD}
\req[\todom{} \waitingForServer]{D87}{The IDE shall provide an interface that explains the steps of how to upgrade a library used in the project to a new version.}{\SHALL}

\subsection{Inspecting Code Chunk Related Q\&A Posts}

Also there are some discussions about how to implement a function using a specific features or a set of libraries. The recommendations which present these documents (posts and blog entries) are represent an other subclass of text based recommendations. To get relevant posts about your code, select it and press the right mouse button and click on the \textit{Request API documentation or QA post} in the CROSSMINER sub-menu. One similar panel as Figure~\ref{fig:apidocumentation} will be showed at the bottom of Eclipse. This panel contains a list of available QA post for your selected code chunk. For further information you can open the listed links (by clicking on them) in your default browser.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pic/apidocumentation.png}
	\caption{Code recommendation view}
	\label{fig:apidocumentation}
\end{figure}

\chapter{User Activity Monitoring}

The main components of this scenario is the recording of developer interactions (events), computing process related metrics and sending them to the CROSSMINER server for further processing. The collected events is stored in a local database. Please note that none of the stored event contains information about the user, so there is no way to identify someone from these data, also all of the events are stored in a local database and only the metrics are sent to the CROSSMINER Server.

\section{List of Collected Events}

\begin{description}
\item[Document event] Our plug-in using it to detect all keypresses in the editor and store which file is affected. For example during the implementation of a new method for an existing class.

\item[Part event] It stores information about life cycle of given parts (part activating, part deactivating, part closing etc). For example when you work on a existing class and select something in the Package Explorer.

\item[Window event] It stores information about window life cycle the same way as the Part event handles information about parts. For example when you open an another program.

\item[Eclipse close event] Eclipse closes are stored in this even type.

\item[Launch event] It stores information about code building and launching.

\item[Resource element event] It stores information about the file saving and deletion.

\item[Class path event] It stores information about class path changing (add entry to class path or removed entry from class path). For example when you add a library to your clashpath.

\item[CROSSMINER event] These events are invoked by using plug-in. It needs to be calculated for those metrics which measure the plug-in usage. For example when you use CROSSMINER Library Search function.
\end{description}

\section{Retrieving Process Metrics via \textsc{crossminer} Web-based Dashboard}

You are able to inspect any computed process metrics for your project by using the relevant features of CROSSMINER Web-based Dashboard.

\section{Plug-in Side Debugging Features}

In the case of unexpected errors during the user activity monitoring, you are able to check the value of the process metrics and some relevant meta-data about the underlying database on the client side. To do this please activate some of the plug-in side debugging features. Please note that these are only available in the debug version of the plug-in. 

\section{Server Side Debugging Features}

There are ways to access the raw data, stored at the server side. To do this you have to execute the following REST API calls. You could use your preferred REST client, but for illustration purposes we will use Postman\footnote{\url{https://www.getpostman.com/}}

\req[\todom\todo{Not IDE!}]{U155}{Eclipse users can easily deactivate the analysis}{\SHALL}

All the plug-in related settings can be found in the plug-in's preference page. To open this page select the Preferences item under the Window menu in Eclipse menu.



\section{Integration Related Settings}

To properly use the plug-in, you have to set some of the settings which is required for integration. As Figure~\ref{fig:preferences_remote} shows you have to enter the Knowledge Base server address, a port and the Web Dashboard's base path.
